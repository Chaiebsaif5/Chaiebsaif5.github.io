# Welcome to my portfolio!

If you're reading this my hope is that you're a recruiter who's at least mildly intrested in my application or profil, so thank you for taking the time to explore it.

This portfolio is structurs into 3 main projects:

## 1.Dashboards:

This includes both PowerBI and Tableau dashboard over a variety of topics (fill with topics here after finalising dashbaords), it also includes (for relevant dashboards) links to databases and corresponding data & insights analysis work which is being visualised, which you should find in the database & analysis project folder in this portfolio.

## 2.Databases, Datasets & Analysis:

As mentioned above this project includes a variety of databases (real-world + AI generated) and the corresponsing analysis and insights extracted from them. This project mainly tries to showcase the technical tools we use in getting from raw data to dashboard-ready insights but it also links back to some actual dashboards (as explained in the previous section) where relevant.

## 3.Multi-purpose:

This project contains all the remaining items and skills that could be potentially useful for your business but are not extensive enough to warrent their own project, this project includes AI and/or ML algorithms passion/hobby side projects that I experemented with, it also includes showcases of webpages I developed and designed (hopefull showcasing both front end and backend skills) and a variety of other technical skills that can have a value-added to your business but are not my essential field of specialisation.

Note: Each project has a README file that covers the technical stack used in it which will include all programs and dependencies you will need to have on you computer to run the files in that project as well as the coding languages, IDEs ect that I used to create and showcase them, I included that latter for your references.
