1. Station Density per 100 km² & per 100 000 Inhabitants
Visual: Filled‐map (choropleth) at the Département or Region level

Details:

Color‐scale keyed to density (e.g. darker = more stations per 100 km²)

Tooltip shows both “per area” and “per population” figures

Tip: Add a slicer for population vs area normalization

2. Temporal Growth Trends
Visual: Line chart (cumulative) + Area chart (installations per period)

Details:

X‑axis = month/quarter of created_at

Y‑axis = cumulative station count (line) or new installs (area)

Tip: Use a date slicer to let users zoom into any time window

3. Price Distribution & Outliers
Visuals:

Box‑and‑whisker plot of Price_1 (or combined) by Region or by Operator

Histogram of prices for a more granular view

Tip: Add a scatter chart with price on Y and station size (nbre_pdc) on X to detect “premium hubs”

4. Accessibility Index
Visual: Stacked‐bar or 100% stacked‐bar by score (0–3) across Regions or Networks

Details:

Each bar = region; segments = share of stations at each accessibility tier

Tip: Include bookmark buttons to highlight only fully accessible (score = 3)

5. Average Points per Station & Skew
Visuals:

Bar chart of average nbre_pdc by Operator or Manager (sorted descending)

Violin plot (if you import R visuals or custom visuals) for distribution

Tip: Add a tooltip with median and skewness metrics on hover

6. Operator Diversification Index
Visual: Matrix visual (cross‑tab) with Managers on rows, Operators on columns; cell value = count of shared stations

Details:

Conditional formatting to spotlight high‐diversification cells

Tip: Drillthrough from any manager to a detailed table of its operators (and vice versa)

7. Free‑to‑Paid Transition Analysis
Visual: Clustered column chart

Details:

X‑axis = time period (before/after policy)

Series = free vs paid %

Tip: Use a vertical line annotation at the policy change date

8. Plug‑Type Diversity Score per Region
Visual: Bar chart or radial gauge

Details:

One bar per region, height = diversity score (0–5)

Or a radial gauge per region for a compact view

Tip: Use a map with size‐scaled bubbles where bubble size = diversity score

9. Nearest‑Neighbor Distance Analysis
Visual: Scatter map (bubble map)

Details:

Plot station lat/long; bubble size = average nearest‐neighbor distance in that local area

Tip: Add cluster layers so dense clusters collapse until zoomed

10. Correlation Matrix of Key Variables
Visual: Heat‑map visual (matrix)

Details:

Matrix with numeric variables on both axes; color = Pearson r

Tip: Filter pane to let users select subsets of variables or drill into pairwise scatter plots

Dashboard Layout Suggestions
Top Bar / KPI Cards:

Total stations, total points, mean price, % free, accessibility average.

Left Pane (Filters):

Region/department slicer, time period slicer, operator/network slicer.

Main Canvas (3×3 tile grid):

Row 1: Density map | Growth trend | Free vs Paid chart

Row 2: Price distribution | Accessibility index | Plug‑type diversity

Row 3: Points‑per‑station bar | Diversification matrix | Correlation heat‑map

Drillthrough Detail Pages:

E.g. click on any region to see full station list and details, or on any operator to see its network.

This layout and these visual types will make your dashboard both informative and interactive, allowing stakeholders to explore each metric in depth. Let me know if you’d like mock‑up examples or DAX snippets for any of these!
